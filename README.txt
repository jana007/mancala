Mancala app created by Jana McKinnon 
--------------------------------------------------
This is a two player game, player one goes first
Player one controls the top 6 pits, their stone store is on the right
Player two controls the bottom 6 pits, their stone store is on the left

There seem to be a huge variety of ways to play Mancala,
this game allows a player to steal stones from the other user's side
if they have circled the board once and have landed in an empty pit on their side

The game ends when one side of the board is empty
The player with stones left on their side receive them all in their store as a bonus

The winner is decided by who possesses the most stones in their store
